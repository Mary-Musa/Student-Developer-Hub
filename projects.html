        <h2>Problem It Solves</h2>
        <p>
            Rural schools often lack access to digital learning tools. 
            This website aims to bridge that gap by providing resources, 
            guidance, and information for digital education initiatives.

        <h2>My Approach</h2>
        <p>
            I created a multi-page HTML5 site with structured navigation, 
            clear content sections, and high-quality media to showcase 
            initiatives like digital classrooms and teacher training.

        <h2>The Hardest Thing I Learned</h2>
        <p>
            The biggest challenge was structuring a multi-page site so that 
            navigation is intuitive and content is accessible to all users, 
            including those with minimal technical background.
